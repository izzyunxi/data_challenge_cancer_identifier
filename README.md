# data challenge assignment during career week after Le Wagon Data Science Bootcamp

# object:
- A medical research team have isolated a number of genes and proteins that may have an influence on the cancer forming.
- This challenge is to build a machine learning model that can help identify whether a patient has a developing adenocarcinoma or not.


# data set:
- minisize of 1k rows
- 7 columns (6 features + 1 target)

# target:
- column 'adenocarcinoma' => whether Flags(1) patient has an adenocarcinoma or not (0)

# features:
- column 'gene1' => gene expression activity
- column 'gene2' => gene expression activity
- column 'gene3' => gene expression activity
- column 'gene4' => gene expression activity
- column 'gene5' => gene expression activity
- column 'proteinA' => presence of proteinA
